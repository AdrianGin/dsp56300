Motorola/Freescale DSP 56300 family emulator work-in-progress

Some intructions are still missing, some may not work.
I mainly focus the DSP 56362. I have no time at the
moment, contributions are welcome. If you find this one
useful, please let me know.

There are a lot of places that can be optimized, it runs
quite slow at the moment, but I wanted it to be quite
stable first before beginning to optimize it.

The test-application is windows-only but the emulator itself
should run on linux aswell, if anyone wants to create a makefile,
feel free to do.
